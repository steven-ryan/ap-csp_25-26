### Detailed mapping
- Big Ideas (the content buckets from College Board)
- Computational Thinking Practices (the skills they grade for)
- Barron’s 2026 chapters (where you’ll teach it from)

| Big Idea | Description | Key Computational Thinking Practices (P1–P6) | Barron’s 2026 Chapter(s) | Notes for Teaching |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Big Idea 1: Creative Development** | Program design, collaboration, documentation, iterative development, Create Task | **P1:** Collaboration, **P3:** Abstraction, **P5:** Testing | Ch. 1–2 | Start Create Task brainstorming early. Emphasize teamwork, documentation, and reflection. |
| **Big Idea 2: Data** | Data representation (binary, images, text, sound), compression, visualization, abstraction | **P2:** Abstraction, **P4:** Communication | Ch. 3 | Do hands-on binary conversions, lossless vs lossy compression, and simple data analysis projects. |
| **Big Idea 3: Algorithms & Programming (Part 1)** | Sequencing, selection, iteration, algorithms, problem solving | **P2:** Abstraction, **P3:** Algorithms, **P5:** Testing | Ch. 4 | Practice AP pseudocode. Compare efficiency of algorithms (e.g., linear vs binary search). |
| **Big Idea 3: Algorithms & Programming (Part 2)** | Procedures, abstraction, efficiency, debugging, testing | **P3:** Algorithms, **P5:** Testing, **P6:** Communication | Ch. 5 | Students write reusable functions and explain them to peers. Tie to Create Task scoring rubric. |
| **Big Idea 4: Computer Systems & Networks** | Internet structure, IP, TCP, DNS, cybersecurity, redundancy, fault tolerance | **P4:** Communication, **P6:** Connecting Computing | Ch. 6 | Use an “internet simulation” (passing envelopes w/ IP addresses). Add discussions on cybersecurity threats. |
| **Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing** | Ethics, privacy, intellectual property, global impact, innovation, society | **P1:** Collaboration, **P4:** Communication, **P6:** Connecting Computing | Ch. 7 | Class debates, case studies (AI bias, digital divide). Great place for reflection journals. |
