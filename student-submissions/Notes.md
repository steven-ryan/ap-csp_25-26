All computers: input-->store-->process-->output



# Stuff to remember
-  computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.
- Computers use binary because their hardware is based on two states (on/off), making it efficient to store and process all types of data, including images and text, as sequences of 0s and 1s.


- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person.








- **Algorithm:** An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task. Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.
- **Arguments:** The values of the parameters when a procedure is called.
- **Collection type:** Aggregates elements in a single structure. Some examples include: databases, hash tables, dictionaries, sets, or any other type that aggregates elements in a single structure.
- **Data stored in a list:** Input into the list can be through an initialization or through some computation on other variables or list elements.
- **Input:** Program input is data that are sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile (through touch), audible, visual, or text. An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.
- **Iteration:** Iteration is a repetitive portion of an algorithm. Iteration repeats until a given condition is met or for a specified number of times. The use of recursion is a form of iteration.
- **List:** A list is an ordered sequence of elements. The use of lists allows multiple related items to be represented using a single variable. Lists are referred to by different terms, such as arrays or arraylists, depending on the programming language.
- **List being used:** Using a list means the program is creating new data from existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list.
- **Output:** Program output is any data that are sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audible, visual, movement, or text.
- **Parameter:** A parameter is an input variable of a procedure. Explicit parameters are defined in the procedure header. Implicit parameters are those that are assigned in anticipation of a call to the procedure. For example, an implicit parameter can be set through interaction with a graphical user interface.
- **Procedure:** A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method, function, or constructor, depending on the programming language.
- **Program code segment:** A code segment refers to a collection of program statements that are part of a program. For text-based, the collection of program statements should be continuous and within the same procedure. For block-based, the collection of program statements should be contained in the same starter block or what is referred to as a “Hat” block.
- **Program functionality:** The behavior of a program during execution, often described by how a user interacts with it.
- **Purpose:** The problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program.
- **Selection:** Selection determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false. The use of try/exception statements is a form of selection statements.
- **Sequencing:** The application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.
- **Student-developed procedure / algorithm:** Program code that is student developed has been written (individually or collaboratively) by the student who submitted the response. Calls to existing program code or libraries can be included but are not considered student developed. Event handlers are built-in abstractions in some languages and will therefore not be considered student-developed. In some block-based programming languages, event handlers begin with “when”.

## Key terms

Sampling ‼️  IMPROVE ‼️ 
> is converting an analog signal to a digital one (p150)

Analog data  〰️ 
> has values that change smoothly over time and are continuous signals (p150)

Digital 1️⃣ / 0️⃣ 
>  data is a analog signal that has been broken up into steps and are discreet time signals (p150)

Abstraction 📚 
>  ~are when bits are grouped to find common fetures and can shrink the size of the code (p149)~
> is a simplified representation of something complex that hides unnecessary details, allowing us to focus on high-level operations or ideas.

Binary 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣1️⃣
> is a way of representing information using only two options.

Bit 0️⃣
> (binary digit) is a single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1.

Lossless compression  🌕
> reduces file size without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed.

Lossy compression 🌔
> reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in a loss of quality. The original data cannot be perfectly restored.

intellectual property 
> any intangible creations of the mind, such as inventions, artistic works, designs, brand names, and symbols.

creative commons 
> a license that allows you to freely use materials created by others.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
>  a character encoding standard that assigns numbers to letters, digits, and symbols so computers can represent and process text.

A pixel 
> the smallest unit of a digital image, representing a single point of color or shade.

bitmap 
> a way of representing an image as a grid of pixels, where each pixel’s value is stored in binary. For black and white images, each pixel is typically 1 bit.

RGB 
> stands for Red, Green, Blue. In digital images, each pixel’s color is created by combining different intensities of these three colors, usually with 8 bits per channel.

Computing Device
> electronic machines that perform tasks automatically by executing instructions, enabling them to process, store, and analyze data

Computing System
> a combination of physical components (hardware) and instructions (software) that work together to perform tasks, such as receiving, storing, processing, and transmitting information

Computing Network
> a collection of two or more interconnected computing devices that share data, resources, and services using physical or wireless connections and agreed-upon communication protocols

Path
> a string of characters that specifies the unique location of a file, directory, or other resource within a file system or a hierarchical structure

Bandwidth
> the maximum theoretical amount of data that can be transmitted over a communication channel within a given period of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
> defines how computers sends data packets to each other. guides how data is subdivided into packets before transmission. 

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
> allows computers to send messages without checking for missing packets to save time. this makes UPD less reliable but faster than TCP.

Sequential Computing
> problem is broken into discrete instructions then executed one by one by a single device having a single CPU

Parallel Computing
> problem is broken into discrete instructions then executed concurrently by using multiple CPUs. it is used for real world simulations and modeling.

Distributed Computing
